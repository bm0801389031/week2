# week2
repository off all my code wars problems, and they're solutions.

1. even or odd
Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

2. clock
Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after
midnight. Your task is to write a function which returns
the time since midnight in milliseconds.
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is
language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should
be an Integer.
