repository off all my code wars problems, and they're solutions.

1. even or odd
Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

2. clock
Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after
midnight. Your task is to write a function which returns
the time since midnight in milliseconds.
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is
language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should
be an Integer.

3. sum of positives & pseudo code pdf
Description:

You get an array of numbers, 
return the sum of all of the 
positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 
1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, 
the sum is default to 0.
